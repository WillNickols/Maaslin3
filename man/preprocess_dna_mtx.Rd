Pre-process the DNA covariates for metatranscriptomics
}
\description{
Pre-process the DNA covariates for metatranscriptomics by
total-sum-scaling DNA
abundances per sample and then, for each sample in each feature:
\enumerate{
    \item{Log 2 transforming the DNA abundance if the DNA abundance is >=0}
    \item{Setting the DNA abundance to \code{log2([minimum non-zero relative
    abundance in the dataset] / 2)} if the corresponding RNA abundance is
    non-zero but the DNA abundance is zero}
    \item{Setting the DNA abundance to NA if both are zero}
}
When the DNA is present, the RNA data can be modeled as usual in MaAsLin
3 with
\code{log2(DNA)} as a covariate. When the DNA is not present, if the RNA
is
present, we assume the DNA was missed due to finite read depth, so the
DNA
abundance is imputed with a small pseudo-count. When neither the DNA nor
RNA is
present, we assume the gene/microbe was not in the sample and therefore
no
information about the transcription level can be obtained. Setting the
DNA
covariate to NA has the effect of dropping the sample when fitting the
relevant
feature's model in MaAsLin 3. Unlike most MaAsLin functions that will
infer the
samples from the row names and column names, \bold{the \code{rna_table}
must be
formated as samples (rows) by features (columns)}.

\usage{
preprocess_dna_mtx(dna_table, rna_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_table}{The samples (rows) by features (columns) data frame of
DNA or
taxon abundances to preprocess. These can be relative abundances or
counts.}
\item{rna_table}{The samples (rows) by features (columns) data frame of
RNA to
preprocess. These can be relative abundances or counts.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following named items:
    \enumerate{
    \item{\code{dna_table}: The table of log2 transformed DNA relative
    abundances with NAs for any feature-sample pairs for which both the DNA
    and
    RNA abundances were 0.}
    \item{\code{rna_table}: The table of total sum scaled RNA abundances.
    These
    are not log2 transformed.}
    }
